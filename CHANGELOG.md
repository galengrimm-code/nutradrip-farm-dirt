## [v1.0.70] - January 17, 2026

### Client/Farm Organizational Structure
- **New**: Hierarchical organization for multi-client operations (Client → Farm → Field)
- **Settings page**: "Active Operation" card to select which client/farm to view
- **Settings page**: "Manage Clients & Farms" card to add/edit/delete clients and farms
- **Auto-filtering**: All pages automatically filter by active client/farm selection
- **Import page**: Assign field boundaries to a specific client/farm when importing
- **Quick-add buttons**: Create new clients or farms directly from the import page
- **Field Management**: Table now shows which farm/client each field belongs to
- **Data migration**: Existing fields automatically assigned to default client/farm on first load

### How It Works
1. Go to Settings → "Manage Clients & Farms" to create clients and farms
2. Select active client/farm in "Active Operation" section
3. Map, Analysis, and Import pages automatically filter to show only selected data
4. When importing boundaries, choose which client/farm they belong to
