## [v1.0.182] - January 26, 2026

### Sample Site Management

- **Hard delete**: Deleting sample sites now permanently removes rows from Google Sheets (was soft delete with Active=FALSE)
- **Location-scoped rename**: Renaming a site only affects that specific GPS location, not all sites with the same name
- **Multi-type delete fix**: Deleting a site with multiple sample types (Tissue + Sap) now removes all types correctly
- **Sheet column fix**: Sample sites now write to correct columns A-J (fixed offset issue)

### Print Samples & Lab Forms

- **Lab Form selector**: Choose between Generic Labels, Waypoint Tissue, or Sap Sample Form
- **Waypoint Tissue template**: Matches Waypoint Analytical's soil sample submission form with S1M/S2M/S3M test packages
- **Sap Sample Form template**: Matches New Age Laboratories/Calibrated Agronomy COC form with sample type checkboxes and vigor ratings
- **Selection fix**: Print samples now only includes checked items (was including all with same SiteID)
- **Auto-fill**: Lab forms auto-fill Sample ID, Field, and client info from selected sites

### Google Auth

- **Longer sessions**: Token refresh now checks every 2 minutes (was 5) and refreshes 30 minutes before expiry (was 10)
- **Tab return refresh**: Auto-refreshes token when returning to browser tab
- **12-hour sessions**: Should stay signed in as long as browser stays open

### Bug Fixes

- **Print filter**: Type filter only shows sample types that actually exist
- **Edit sample sites**: Can now rename sites and update notes
- **Multi-select types**: Creating a site with multiple types works correctly

---

## [v1.0.75] - January 24, 2026

### Organic Matter (OM) Improvements

- **Stricter OM stability thresholds**: CV <10% Stable, 10-20% Moderate, >20% Volatile (vs standard 20/30%)
- **Dedicated OM card builder**: Replaces generic nutrient card with agronomic-specific recommendations
- **Three OM levers** mapped to 5-trigger framework:
  - **Increase carbon inputs**: Cover crops (cereal rye, triticale), extend living roots, maintain residue
  - **Reduce carbon loss**: Reduce tillage intensity, avoid unnecessary disturbance
  - **Import carbon**: Manure/compost to lowest OM zones (credit nutrients properly)
- **OM-specific volatility warning**: "OM is sensitive to sampling depth and lab method; keep depth consistent and use the same lab/method across years."
- **Multi-year expectation note**: Always shows "OM changes slowly in most corn/soy systems. Treat OM trends as multi-year signals, not year-to-year decisions."

### Sample Site Pin Drop

- **Site ID generated on save**: Shows "(Generated on save)" placeholder until Save button clicked
- **Client/Farm validation**: Requires selection before saving
- **Improved field detection**: Added console logging for debugging when field not detected

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Google Sheets sync duplication**: Changed from `append` to `update` API calls for Clients, Farms, Fields, and Samples tabs. Prevents duplicate data when sync is called multiple times.
- **Fixed Field Trends bug**: Renamed duplicate `getNutrientThresholds` function that was causing nutrient cards to crash

---

## [v1.0.74] - January 23, 2026

### Field Trends - Nutrient Insights

- **P:Zn Ratio Insights**: 5-case tiered recommendations based on ratio level AND zinc sufficiency
  - Shows current P, Zn, and ratio values with actionable guidance
  - "Why ratios matter" tooltip explaining agronomic context
  - Added to both single field and operation-wide views

- **Organic Matter Tips**: Actionable improvement tips when OM is below threshold
  - Triggers when OM < 2.0% (critical) or below optimal with flat/declining trend
  - 4 specific tips: cover crops, reduced tillage, compost/manure, crop residue
  - Always visible (not collapsible) for immediate visibility

- **Zinc Improvement Insights**: Comprehensive 3-tier guidance system
  - Low (<50% target), Marginal (50-100%), Adequate (≥100%)
  - Dynamic Zn target based on P level: `max(1.5 ppm, P/10)` to maintain 10:1 ratio
  - Shows calculated target with explanation when elevated due to high P
  - P:Zn ratio used as context, not primary trigger

### Methodology Page

- **New page**: `methodology.html` documenting all calculations used in the app
- **8 sections**: Stability Scores, Trend Analysis, Nutrient Ratios, Thresholds, Averages, Yield Correlation, Spatial Analysis, Color Scaling
- **Formulas**: Code-style boxes with exact formulas (CV, linear regression, Pearson r, etc.)
- **Agronomic context**: "Why it matters" notes explaining the science
- **Navigation**: Jump links and collapsible sections
- **Footer links**: Added "How We Calculate" link to all page footers
- **Settings card**: Prominent link card added to Settings page

### Settings

- **pH default change**: Updated optimal range from 6.0-7.0 to 6.3-7.0

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed**: Year dropdown now hidden when stability attributes selected (stability uses all years)
- **Improved**: Stability legend shows "CV% across all years" for clarity

---

## [v1.0.73] - January 21, 2026

### Dynamic Zoom-Based Color Scaling
- **New**: Field colors now based on only VISIBLE fields on screen (not all fields)
- **Dynamic legend**: Shows current visible range (e.g., "18 - 45 ppm")
- **Auto-updates on pan/zoom**: Color scale recalculates as you move the map
- **Better detail**: See subtle differences when zoomed into areas with similar values
- **Debounced updates**: 150ms delay prevents excessive recalculations

### Google Sheet URL Support
- **Accept full URLs**: Paste entire Google Sheet URL instead of just the ID
- **Auto-extraction**: Sheet ID automatically extracted from URL
- **Backwards compatible**: Still accepts just the ID if preferred
- **Shows confirmation**: "Sheet ID detected: 1ABC..." after parsing

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed**: Sheet ID extraction - was using full URL instead of extracted ID
- **Fixed**: CONFIG.SHEET_ID getter now extracts ID from stored URLs

### UI Improvements
- **Footer links**: Added Privacy Policy and Terms of Service links to all pages
- **Google verification**: Added Search Console verification file

---

## [v1.0.72] - January 20, 2026

## [v1.0.71] - January 20, 2026

### Google Sheets Sync Improvements

- **Removed manual sync button**: No longer needed since everything auto-syncs
- **New "Load from Google Sheets" button**: Pull data from Sheets to sync across devices
- **Safer sync**: Sync now only writes data, never clears existing data from Sheets
- **Clients/Farms tabs**: Auto-created in Google Sheets when first syncing

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed**: Import page syntax error causing data not to load
- **Fixed**: Data loading on mobile - samples and boundaries now load independently
- **Fixed**: Removed auto-created "Default Farm" - defaults to "All" until user creates structure

---

## [v1.0.70] - January 17, 2026

### Client/Farm Organizational Structure
- **New**: Hierarchical organization for multi-client operations (Client → Farm → Field)
- **Settings page**: "Active Operation" card to select which client/farm to view
- **Settings page**: "Manage Clients & Farms" card to add/edit/delete clients and farms
- **Auto-filtering**: All pages automatically filter by active client/farm selection
- **Import page**: Assign field boundaries to a specific client/farm when importing
- **Quick-add buttons**: Create new clients or farms directly from the import page
- **Field Management**: Table now shows which farm/client each field belongs to
- **Data migration**: Existing fields automatically assigned to default client/farm on first load

### How It Works
1. Go to Settings → "Manage Clients & Farms" to create clients and farms
2. Select active client/farm in "Active Operation" section
3. Map, Analysis, and Import pages automatically filter to show only selected data
4. When importing boundaries, choose which client/farm they belong to

---

## [v1.0.45] - January 15, 2026
